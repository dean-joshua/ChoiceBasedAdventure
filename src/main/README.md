# Overview

This is a choice based adventure game. It takes place in a fantasy world known as the World of One. When the game starts
you can name your character and enjoy your own choice based adventure. 

I created this game for the purpose of learning more about the Kotlin programming language and the Intellij IDE. This
was my first experience with Kotlin. I took this opportunity to learn about basic syntax, variables, functions, loops,
conditionals, classes, and Kotlin's when statements.
